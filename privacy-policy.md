Welcome to AI Caption & Hashtag Generator ("we," "our," or "us").
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your information.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our mobile application.

By using our app, you agree to this policy.

1. Information We Collect
We may collect the following types of information:

Authentication Information:
When you sign up or log in, we collect your email address (or other login information) through Firebase Authentication.
This is only used to authenticate your access and manage your account.

Favorites Data:
If you save captions or hashtags as favorites, this data is securely stored and linked to your account if logged in.

User-Provided Content:
Images, descriptions, and other content you upload are used only for generating captions.
(We do not permanently store your uploaded images unless you explicitly save favorites.)

Analytics Information:
We collect anonymous data like device type, app usage patterns, crash reports, etc., using third-party services like Firebase Analytics.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information collected to:

Authenticate users securely using Firebase Authentication.

Generate captions and hashtags based on your input.

Save and retrieve your favorite captions.

Improve app functionality, stability, and performance.

Communicate with users if needed (support, security updates).

We do NOT:

Sell or share your personal information with third parties.

Store your uploaded images after caption generation (unless saved).

3. Data Storage and Security
We use Firebase Authentication for secure login and user management.

Favorites data is stored securely with Firebase Firestore (or local device storage, depending on the app design).

Uploaded images are processed temporarily and not stored unless saved by you.

We implement technical security measures to protect your data.
